# Everything Cocktails Website
The Everthing Cocktails Website is coded with React Javascript and made use of a cocktail database from https://www.thecocktaildb.com/ to provide information about a variety of cocktails including ingredients and preparation instructions.
NOTE: I wanted to play around with user interactions on web browsers so the mobile version of page was not added into consideration.

Visit https://www.figma.com/file/FBuZUw4KWXO2lFsN3aRSyP/Cocktails-Website?node-id=180%3A737 for Figma Designs that the app (mostly) followed

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
